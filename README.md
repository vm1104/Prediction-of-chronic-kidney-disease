•	Performed Data cleaning which involved converting some object data into numeric 
  data, Filtering data into numeric and categoric data, making sure all unique values
  present in feature categories
  
  
•	Analyzed  correlation of data using a heatmap to visualize relationships between features and identify multicollinearity.


•	Performed exploratory data analysis using Violin, Scatter, Kde plots to understand feature distributions and relationships.


•	Cleaned missing values using random value and mode imputation for numerical and categorical data  to maintain data integrity.
  
  
•	Performed Feature Encoding using Label Encoder from sklearn for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
